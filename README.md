## How to compile

cd into /api and run
```go build api```
This will compile and leave the binary in the current directory

```go install```
Run this if you want to leave the binary in the bin folder of your gopath

## TODO
* Find out what to cache and how
* Do the rest of the endpoints
* Learn interfaces cuz idk how to use em xd
